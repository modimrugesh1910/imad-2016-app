Hi,
	My Name is Mrugesh Modi. I am currently studying final year of B.Tech(ICT) at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology(DA-IICT), Gandhinagar, Gujarat. 
  I am lived in the hostel of college. I am interested as Software Engineer and Web Developer. I have explored in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL in Web Technologies.
  I also know C and java programming Language. My passion is to build awesome stuff and learn more by self effort. I want to work with curious and amazing people. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	I have built a simple web app using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, BootStrap and jQuery. In the app first I gave simple Introduction of myself. 
  Then I have mentioned my projects and social connections like facebook, GitHub, Twitter, and LinkedIn. In part of articles I have created jQuery Slider where I introduce my interest. 
  I also introduce my favourite series and movies in sliders. I included google search tab in the home page. I also tried login-sessions to authenticate commenters by id.
  
  My app is on - http://modimrugesh1910.imad.hasura-app.io/ui/index.html
